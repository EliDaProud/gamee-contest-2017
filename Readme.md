## The goal
 
In this repository there is one of our games, Spinner Winner. 

We intentionaly removed implementation of save state. 

Your task is to implement save state back correctly. If you can manage it, play a game with save state for a while. Game should reveal its secret how to continue. 

The entry dates for the contest will be from 24th of June 2017 until 8th of July 2017.

## How can I run the game?

First, clone this repository. 

Then use configured dev tools. Open terminal and use

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

to install external modules and run the project and automatic builds. The game will be published on your ```http://localhost:3000```.
Pass this link to our [public emulator](http://emulator.gameeapp.com/).

Then search our [github wiki](https://github.com/gameeapp/gamee-js/wiki) to understand how to fix the implementation. 

Good luck!
